# GoLink's Hackathon

# Task: 

Create an app that gives the user a list of dog breeds available in the dog API and let the user interact with the data.

api documentation: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/

# Basic Requirements:
* We prefer it if you write your code in Kotlin but if you must, Java works as well.
* Listview or Recyclerview that shows a list of all breed names available In the API.
* User taps the listview cell or viewHolder of the specific breed and that transitions to another view with a title of the breed name and 15 photos of the specific breed laid out in whatever way you think makes sense/ looks good.
* Notice in the API there are some cases where there is a “Breed” and a “Sub-breed”. In the case that there is a “Sub-breed” we want you to not show the specific “Breed” name in the original list but rather prepend or append the “Breed” name to the “Sub-breed” name and add that to the list. (Prepend or Append is your call, whatever you think makes sense).
* The API is pretty quick to respond but in some cases getting the data from the API might take a few seconds. Please show the user an indication that data is loading if that’s the case.
* Make sure that a user is able to navigate to the original list after looking at the 15 pictures of a specific breed.
* If the breed is a Whippet, make the background of the whippet specific view pink.
* If the breed is an Italian greyhound, make the background of the specific Italian greyhound view purple.
* Make the list readable.
* Bonus points if you make a clean UI.

# Instructions:

The requirements are left vague on purpose to see your creative ability to architect a solution here. After you finish your project, our team will set up a time with you to present your project. We will walk through the code, ask you questions to get to know you better and this will also be a great opportunity for you to ask us questions. Please submit your project to a public repo on Github so the engineering team can review your code. Good luck and happy hacking!
